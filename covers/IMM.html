<p>I am super excited to discover a hiring company that lists strongest shades of my developer profile as job requirements. More specifically</p>
<ul>
<li>You are looking for someone to <em>mentor and help lead a team</em> &mdash; I have a 10 years of professorship experience where mentoring students is one of my duties</li>
<li>You need someone who can <em>implement designs into a fully responsive website</em> &mdash; I have practical experience in prototyping and building responsive website to support operation of the High School Math Tournament (more details can be found at <a href="https://baev.work/project">https://baev.work/project</a>)</li>
<li>You are looking for a “self-motivated” individuals &mdash; I went though the whole process of learning modern practices of web development (Node.JS, MongoDB, ES6, CSS3, VusJS, etc) only on the fuel of self motivation. </li>
</ul>
<p>I am looking for a change in my professional occupation because my present employment no longer challenges me enough so I could say “I am the one of only a few who can do it”. I really would like to be employed by a company where my potential can be opened and exploited to the full capacity, where my 10 years of educational experience can serve the need of project management and successfull  collaboration, where my tune for details handling can be hired to create progressive and usable interfaces. </p>
<p>In short, I do believe that <em>Ideas Made Measurable</em> can be that place.</p>
