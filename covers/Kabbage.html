<p>I am excited with the opportunity to apply for a Software Engineer position at Kabbage because of a few reasons. Although all of them are important, I’d like to frame the main one. It is influenced by the specification of job duties that I read on the posting: </p>
<p><em>Full-stack engineering experience in any of the following languages and frameworks: C#, Java, JavaScript, Typescript, Angular 4 and 5, NodeJS, WebApi, .Net Core, Entity Framework, SQL</em>.</p>
<p>It is not that I know all these technologies, I don’t… but it is in the phrase “<strong>any of the following languages and frameworks</strong>“. It makes me believe that you are looking for someone who has a limited knowledge, but at the same time has a confidence and openness for anything new. Particularly I have practical experience and judging opinion on <strong>NodeJS</strong> + <strong>MongoDB</strong> to construct a reliable and performant <em>backend</em>, and <strong>VueJS</strong> fueled by HTML5/CSS3 and <strong>Webpack</strong> to build a catchy looking <em>frontent</em> &mdash; it doesn’t mean I am against SQL and/or Java and/or Angular… I simply didn’t practice enough with them. </p>
<p>I am looking for a change in the professional occupation because my present employment no longer challenges me enough so I could say “I am the one of only a few who can do it”. I really would like to be employed by a company where my potential can be opened and exploited to the full capacity, where my 10 years of professional experience in higher education can serve the need of project management and successfull collaboration, where my tune for details handling can be hired to create progressive and usable interfaces. </p>
<p>In short, I do believe that <em>Kabbage</em> can be that place.</p>
