Redlands, CA 92373 <br></header><article><p> </p><span class="h5">Dear HR Manager:</span> <br><br>
<p>I am a full stack developer who puts a big emphasis on usability and responsiveness of the frontend. I also have a good understanding of how the frontend needs to be composed so it can be a good fit for an existing or newly developed backend. I always analyze UI from the standpoint of “natural consumption” which means it has to be minimal, efficient, and highly intuitive. </p>
<p>I am super excited to find a hiring company that lists strongest shades of my developer profile as job requirements. More specifically</p>
<ul>
<li>You need someone with “excellent JavaScript/HTML/CSS skills and good sense for software architecture” &mdash; I prefer not to use words like “excellent” or “best” to describe myself, but I have a good fair experience in all these technologies.</li>
<li>You need someone with “excellent communication skills to clearly articulate the reasons behind design decisions” &mdash; skipping “excellent” I can say that articulation of details and pasion to clear up fuzzy moments would be my strongest sides. </li>
<li>You are looking for someone with a formal degree… I have a few ranging from BS, MS, and Ph.D in electrical engineering (one of my previous professional lives) and MS in computer engineering. Although my web development skillset is selfdeveloped, degree-free evolution that meets my current vision to modern trends in computing profession.   </li>
</ul>
<p>I am very much excited about modern web technology and am willing to switch my comfortable tenured academia hosted occupation to something flavoured with pasion, freshness, and satisfaction &mdash; I hope to find all these at Esri. </p>
